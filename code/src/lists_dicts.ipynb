There are two main types of paint: water-based paint (including waterborne acrylics. and acrylic latex paints) and solvent-based paint (also known as alkyd or oil-based enamel paints).\\nPaint is produced by combining resin. solvents. pigment. and additives. Resins are used to bind together the ingredients. For solvent-based paint these include: dammar. mastic. copal and alkyd resin. Pigments are added to create colour and sheen. and can include calcium carbonate. talc. oxides and mica amongst others. Solvents such as mineral spirits or turpentine are used to dilute and thin the paint. Other additives are included to reduce drying time and give the paint particular properties.\\nSolvent-based paints are becoming less common. due to the high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present. Paints with high levels of VOCs are toxic to the environment. have a harsh odour and can be dangerous to inhale. Solvent-based paints are cheaper and tougher than the water-based alternative. and are commonly used in high-traffic areas (although they are more susceptible to UV deterioration). They are more abrasion resistant and have a more brilliant gloss. with a smooth finish. They are difficult to clean. and require mineral turpentine. rather than water.',\n",

Both include a decorative colour or print on the front and an adhesive paste to fix it to the wall.\\nWoven wallpapers are typically made from fabric. or heavy cotton. which is coated (often with an acrylic or polyvinyl coating). Non-woven wallpaper is made from paper. natural fibres. or synthetic materials. A backing adhesive is either applied manually. or included as a precoated layer. The backing paste is typically made from starch. wheat-derived. or a vinyl-based adhesive. Patterns are printed using a variety of printing techniques depending on the aesthetic style. and backing material used.\\nWallpaper is predominantly used for decorative purposes. It varies significantly in cost. depending on the production quality and materials used.',\n",

       "  'material_description': 'Cross laminated timber (CLT) is a manufactured timber product. similar to plywood. Solid timber members are bonded together. with the grain alternating by 90 degrees for each lamination. CLT is much thicker than traditional plywood and has superior structural capabilities. It has excellent dimensional stability. strength and rigidity.\\nCLT is fabricated using a range of different timber varieties. It is typically bonded together using melamine urea formaldehyde. polyurethane or other adhesives.\\nCLT has different structural capabilities when compared with conventional timber. and acts as a sheet product. rather than a framing product. It can be used as a complete floor. wall or roof system. without the need for additional supporting members.',\n",

AAC materials can be sanded and cut to size using standard power tools and have superior thermal properties to standard concrete.\\nAAC comes in a variety of product types. including blocks and panels. AAC blocks are typically used for domestic wall construction and are available as a 600 mm wide and 200 mm high block in thicknesses ranging from 50 to 300 mm. Blocks can be used for loadbearing walls up to three storeys. Panels are often used for both wall and floor construction in residential and commercial applications.

The density of timber is highly dependent on the species. varying from 120 kg/m³ to 1 300 kg/m³ or higher.\\nSoftwood generally has a lower density and better workability than hardwood varieties. It is comparably cheap due to the fast growing nature of many softwood plantation varieties. It is widely used for timber framing purposes. feature walls. door and windows.\\nCommercial timber products are typically kiln. or air-dried.

Cypress and Spruce and hardwood varieties such as Victorian Ash. Blackbutt and Oak. The term hardwood and softwood is a botanical distinction. and not an indication of timber strength or density. The density of timber is highly dependent on the species. varying from 120 kg/m³ to 1 300 kg/m³ or higher.\\nHardwood is generally more dense and durable than softwood varieties. with better longevity. Some hardwoods are naturally resistant to termites and pests and more fire resistant. It is commonly used for high traffic areas. quality furnishings and interior joinery. structural members. cladding and flooring.\\nCommercial timber products are typically kiln. or air-dried. Kiln/oven drying is done in a controlled environment over a relatively short time period. It produces a uniformly dried. high quality product that generally kills any fungi and insects in the wood. Air-drying is done over extended periods of time. and does not require any fuel inputs. It is cost effective. but needs to be carefully managed to reduce cracking and ensure consistent drying.',\n",

PVC is the third most produced plastic. globally.\\nPVC is produced by polymerising vinyl chloride monomers. mostly through suspension polymerisation. followed by emulsion and bulk polymerisation. This generates heat and requires cooling and water. The resulting sludge is filtered. centrifuged. and dried. before being converted to pellets. These can be molten for moulding or extrusion. Multiple additives can be added to PVC to enhance its properties. notably chloride to enhance its resistance to ultraviolet light.\\nuPVC is widely used in the construction industry. Its main uses include window frames. doors. pipes. and gutters.',\n",

Cypress and Spruce and hardwood varieties such as Victorian Ash. Blackbutt and Oak. The term hardwood and softwood is a botanical distinction. and not an indication of timber strength or density. The density of timber is highly dependent on the species. varying from 120 kg/m³ to 1 300 kg/m³ or higher.\\nHardwood is generally more dense and durable than softwood varieties. with better longevity. Some hardwoods are naturally resistant to termites and pests and more fire resistant. It is commonly used for high traffic areas. quality furnishings and interior joinery. structural members. cladding and flooring.\\nCommercial timber products are typically kiln. or air-dried. Kiln/oven drying is done in a controlled environment over a relatively short time period. It produces a uniformly dried. high quality product that generally kills any fungi and insects in the wood. Air-drying is done over extended periods of time. and does not require any fuel inputs. It is cost effective. but needs to be carefully managed to reduce cracking and ensure consistent drying.',\n",

Portland cement is the most commonly used binder. however other binders. such as polymers. may also be used. Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) such as Fly Ash and Ground. Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS). are also commonly used as a part replacement for Portland cement. Additives. such as plasticisers can be added to the mix to control concrete properties. such as workability. Concrete is usually combined with steel reinforcement to improve tensile strength.\\nConcrete is one of the most commonly used construction materials. It is highly durable and is thus typically used for structural elements in buildings and infrastructure projects. Concrete can be manufactured to meet a variety of strength grades. Concrete 25 MPa is commonly used in domestic and commercial floor construction and is considered to be a multi-purpose concrete mix. The typical mix ratio is 1:1:2 (cement. sand. coarse aggregate).',\n",

Clay is prepared and mixed to ensure consistent particle size and mineral content. The clay is then extruded. soft moulded or dry pressed into brick shaped forms. The bricks are dried in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. and fired in a high temperature oven/kiln. Coatings. glazing or textures are applied to give the brick its final appearance. The colour of a brick largely depends on the mineral content of the clay and final firing temperature.\\nBricks are commonly used for external cladding. loadbearing walls. flooring. and other construction elements.
