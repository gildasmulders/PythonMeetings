Its lightweight nature. which is 20% lighter than standard concrete. makes it easier to work with. AAC materials can be sanded and cut to size using standard power tools and have superior thermal properties to standard concrete.
AAC comes in a variety of product types. including blocks and panels. AAC blocks are typically used for domestic wall construction and are available as a 600 mm wide and 200 mm high block in thicknesses ranging from 50 to 300 mm. Blocks can be used for loadbearing walls up to three storeys. Panels are often used for both wall and floor construction in residential and commercial applications.

The molten steel is usually further processed before being cast into sheet. These steel sheets are then corrugated using roll forming. The corrugated steel sheets are finally galvanised by applying a coat of zinc crystals on their surface to significantly improve their resistance to corrosion.
Corrugated steel sheets are widely used in the construction industry. mainly as roofing. cladding. separations and permanent formwork.";Roofing. cladding. separations. permanent formwork;;0.0795793899783472;73.35676561858773;5.488623534598521;1.0;3.26

It can protective coating for timber. metals. plastics and plaster products. There are two main types of paint: water-based paint (including waterborne acrylics. and acrylic latex paints) and solvent-based paint (also known as alkyd or oil-based enamel paints).
Paint is produced by combining resin. solvents. pigment. and additives. Resins are used to bind together the ingredients. For solvent-based paint these include: dammar. mastic. copal and alkyd resin. Pigments are added to create colour and sheen. and can include calcium carbonate. talc. oxides and mica amongst others. Solvents such as mineral spirits or turpentine are used to dilute and thin the paint. Other additives are included to reduce drying time and give the paint particular properties.
Solvent-based paints are becoming less common. due to the high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present. Paints with high levels of VOCs are toxic to the environment. have a harsh odour and can be dangerous to inhale. Solvent-based paints are cheaper and tougher than the water-based alternative. and are commonly used in high-traffic areas (although they are more susceptible to UV deterioration). They are more abrasion resistant and have a more brilliant gloss. with a smooth finish. They are difficult to clean. and require mineral turpentine. rather than water.";Exterior and internal finishes. sealant. weatherproofing;;0.1241111222588804;196.53832765563405;6.2571024479987525;1.0;0.075

There are two main types of wallpaper - woven and non-woven. Both include a decorative colour or print on the front and an adhesive paste to fix it to the wall.
Woven wallpapers are typically made from fabric. or heavy cotton. which is coated (often with an acrylic or polyvinyl coating). Non-woven wallpaper is made from paper. natural fibres. or synthetic materials. A backing adhesive is either applied manually. or included as a precoated layer. The backing paste is typically made from starch. wheat-derived. or a vinyl-based adhesive. Patterns are printed using a variety of printing techniques depending on the aesthetic style. and backing material used.
Wallpaper is predominantly used for decorative purposes. It varies significantly in cost. depending on the production quality and materials used.";Interior decoration;;0.2626676770502678;447.80649253547057;16.022318980880236;1.0;0.173077

Water-based paints have several advantages over oil-based alternatives. They are excellent for external applications. and have high tolerance to UV. They have a low odour. are easy to clean. and are less hazardous to dispose of. They also have better flexibility. dry faster. and are generally more environmentally friendly due to the low amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). which are commonly found in solvent-based paints.

Bricks are made from clay. which is an abundant resource across most of the world. Clay is prepared and mixed to ensure consistent particle size and mineral content. The clay is then extruded. soft moulded or dry pressed into brick shaped forms. The bricks are dried in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. and fired in a high temperature oven/kiln. Coatings. glazing or textures are applied to give the brick its final appearance. The colour of a brick largely depends on the mineral content of the clay and final firing temperature.
