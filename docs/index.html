        This is the online "syllabus" for our exploration of Python. You can navigate through the course's material using the links in the left panel.
        So far, it is mostly empty and the one notebook we do have is not that well documented, but we will populate this syllabus in the coming weeks.

        <h3>Getting started</h3>
            <h4>Running locally</h4>
            To execute python code in a Jupyter Notebook the way we did last times, you can follow the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Open Pycharm and then open the folder where we worked so far.</li>
                <li>Open the Pycharm terminal and then type in
                    <pre>jupyter-lab</pre> followed by the ENTER key to launch the notebook.
                </li>
            </ol> 
            
            
            <h4>Running on binder</h4>
            Alternatively, you can interact with the notebooks directly by opening this: 
            <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gildasmulders/PythonMeetings.git/gh-pages?labpath=%2Fdocs%2Fcode" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://static.mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="binder link">
            </a>.
            <p>This will take some time to build but you should then be redirected to the jupyter-lab interface. </p>
